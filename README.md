## Course Notes and Code from Dan Wahlin's Udemy course entitled 'Learn to Build AngularJS Custom Directives with Dan Wahlin'

If you'd like to read through my course notes -- the file called 'custom_directives.md' -- you'll want to view the raw file, because there's quite a lot of html in the notes that will not render as such in the compiled markdown file.

I've also downloaded and included Dan Wahlin's code from the course.

**My notes are no substitute for [the course itself](https://www.udemy.com/angularjs-custom-directives/), which I highly recommend you experience yourself if you're looking for an in-depth tutorial on writing custom AngularJS directives.**
